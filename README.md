# Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction
Currently rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. The purpose of this movement is to modernize cities and encourage people to head to a green world. Let's take the examples of Paris in 2007, where "velibs" were introduced and Amsterdam, where there are more bikes than cars. The goal is to facilitate the commute in the Seoul and reduce the amount of cars and the pollution. Indeed, the development of the way to commute reduced the use of cars to go to work and visit the city.

# How many bikes are rented per hour in function of weather conditions ?

The goal of the company Seoul Bike is providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes. It becomes a major concern to keep user satisfied. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count rents at each hour for a stable supply of rental bikes. We can suppose that this study could be reported to the company 'Seoul Bikes'. We think it could help them knowing if yes or not they have to supply bikes stations in the city, in order to keep a good satisfaction of the customers.

windy
➢ It is observed that highest number bike rentals counts in Autumn & Summer seasons & the
